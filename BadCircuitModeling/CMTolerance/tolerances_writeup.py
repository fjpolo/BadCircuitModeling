# # Bad Circuit Modelling
#
# I want to start by addressing something I've heard a few times in the
# world of virtual analog modelling for digital audio effects. Let's say
# I wanted to make a model of the famous LA-2A optical compressor. So I buy
# an actual LA-2A, I take measurements, analyze the circuit diagrams, etc,
# and construct a virtual model of the effect. In recent years, modelling
# accuracy has reached the point where it is possible to construct a model
# that sounds more like my unit than my unit sounds compared to another unit
# of the same make.
#
# In the analog modelling world, this level of precision is often considered
# a great success, and without a doubt, achieving that level of precision
# is certainly a great feat of engineering, requiring a deep knowledge of
# the system being modelled, as well as incredible attention to detail.
# However, from an audio perspective, I would consider this result somewhat
# of a failure.
#
# When I buy an LA-2A, I an buying a unique piece of hardware, that sounds
# unlike anything else in the world. This uniqueness, particularly when
# compounded across the many effects used in a production, can give my
# sounds an interesting character that is specific to my studio. On the
# other hand if I use a software model of an LA-2A, the version on my
# computer will sound exactly the same as everyone else's. For some mixing
# engineers this uniformity is seen as a good thing: if I go to someone
# else's studio and they have the same plugins as I do, I can be assured
# they will sound exactly the same as I am accustomed to. That said, in
# my experience as a mixing engineer, the variations in hardware effects
# can add a ton of positive elements to a mix, including stereo width,
# perceptual depth, and once again, a characteristic sound of _my_ studio.
#
# In this series, I'm planning to explore some of the elements that can
# cause variations in analog effects. While I plan to focus mostly on
# basic electrical components (resistors, capacitors, etc), similar ideas
# can usually be applied to more complex circuit elements, as well as
# other analog audio elements including speaker cones, guitar strings,
# magnetic tape, and more.
#
# ## Component Tolerances:
#
# ![pic](https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Resistor-color-codes-Q1.png)
#
# In this article, we'll be talking about component tolerances, one of the
# most fundamental causes of variations in analog circuits. The basic idea
# is that no electrical component can be manufactured with perfect
# precision. With that in mind, manufacturers label their parts with
# a tolerance rating. So if you buy a 500 Ohm resistor, the resistor will
# also have a tolerance rating, say +/- 5%, or +/- 1%, or something of the
# sort. In general, for a more precise overall circuit, it is better to use
# parts with lower tolerance ratings, however, such parts are also more
# expensive, so circuit designers try to build robust designs that can
# handle a little bit of component variation, and will often optimize
# their circuit to find a balance between cost and precision.
#
# ## Circuit Analysis
#
# As an example of this phenomenon, let's analyze and construct a model
# of an ideal Sallen-Key second-order lowpass filter.

# Note that in this idealized model, we will assume that the op-amp
# provides perfect, linear gain, as opposed to the more nonlinear
# response that might be observed in real life. From this model, we can
# can calculate the cutoff frequency and Q value for the filter as
# follows:
#
# $$
# f_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi R C}
# $$
# $$
# Q = \frac{1}{2 - \frac{R_2}{R_1}}
# $$
#
# Now let's design our example filter such that $f_c = 1 \text{ kHz}$,
# and $Q = 2$. In other words, we choose $C = 4.7 \text{ nF}$,
# $R = 33.8 \text{ kOhms}$, $R_2 = 1.5 \text{ kOhms}$, and
# $R_1 = 1 \text{ kOhms}$. When we construct a digital model of this filter
# we obtain the following frequency response.

# specifically by including component tolerances as part of our model. For
# now we'll use a Gaussian distribution for the randomness of our component
# values, but we'll discuss more realistic distributions in more detail
# later on.

# The following plot demonstrates how the frequency response varies for 
# different levels of component tolerance:

# Now I should note that the above plot is a little bit of an exaggeration,
# with regards to the actual variations present in analog hardware. First
# off, 10% is a pretty large tolerance, and one would expect manufacturers,
# particularly those who make high-end gear, to use higher quality parts.
# Additionally, most respectable hardware makers have some form of quality
# control both in rejecting abnormally bad components before including them
# in their circuits, as well as testing their completed products before they
# are shipped. So the actual variation in a lowpass filter circuit that
# you might buy should never be quite as bad as that shown in the plot above,
# but the basic idea that such variation exists definitely still stands.
#
# ## Probability Distributions
#
# When I first started looking at this idea of introducing component
# tolerances into circuit models, I had expected the actual component
# values to follow a more or less Gaussian distribution. The reality
# turns out to be a bit more complicated. Although there appears to be
# a lack of academic writing on the subject, engineers and hackers seem to
# agree that actual component values follow something like a
# "truncated Gaussian" distribution. The interested reader is encouraged
# to read this insightful and humorous article on the subject from
# Howard Johnson [[link](https://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/signal-integrity/4363408/7-solution)].

# ## Implementation
#
# Now for an audio plugin to include component tolerances, is actually a
# pretty simple matter. As an example, I've developed a simple plugin
# that models the Sallen-Key lowpass filter circuit from above, and includes
# an option to change the component tolerances. In my implementation, the
# values of each component for each tolerance are calculated when the
# plugin is initialized, using the truncated Gaussian distribution. Another
# option could be for plugin manufacturers to generate some sort of random
# seed from the registration or installation process of their plugin, so
# _your_ copy of their plugin will sound the same every time you use it,
# but will sound different from everybody elses.
#
# Another important thing to consider (in my opinion), is to use different
# components for the two channels of a stereo effect, so that for tolerance
# values greater than zero, the circuits being modelled between the two
# channels is not exactly the same. For large component tolerances, this
# stereo mismatch can make the effect seem unbalananced, and sort of "lean"
# to one side, however for smaller values it still sounds correct,
# while lending the sound a little bit of extra stereo "width", that would
# be missing otherwise.
